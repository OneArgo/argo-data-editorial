These evolutions are managed by the Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT), under the umbrella of the ADMT.\n\n## The NVS\nThe NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) provides access to lists of standardised terms that cover a broad spectrum of the oceanographic domain and associated communities. The NVS is technically-managed and hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), a national facility that is part of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre (NOC). Key funding sources for the NVS include the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as well as European Union’s initiatives such as the Open Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, the SeaDataNet / SeaDataCloud projects and the Horizons 2020 ENVRI-FAIR project.\n\nThe NVS conforms to a set of standards designed to be compatible with Semantic Web tools and technologies, allowing its content to support the interoperability of datasets on the Web known as Linked Data. The NVS can be accessed via content negotiation (as RDF/XML), SPARQL endpoint or SOAP web services, upon which browser access is built.\n \n\n## VocPrez\nThe NVS web user interface is called VocPrez, and can be accessed through the link vocab.nerc.ac.uk. VocPrez hosts general information on controlled vocabularies, a complete list of NVS collections (under ‘Vocabularies’) and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) concept schemes (under ‘Thesauri’), an interactive SPARQL endpoint to allow for machine-readable NVS query responses, and link to other tools hosted on the BODC website.\n\nOne of the most useful features of VocPrez is the NVS Search interface. This allows a user to search for a term (aka ‘concept’) in a vocabulary collection; search for a term across vocabulary collections; search for vocabulary collections; and explore mappings (i.e. relationships) of terms linking different collections. Search results may be downloaded in tab-delimited (tsv) as well as comma-delimited (csv) formats; moreover, search queries produce search results links that may be bookmarked and shared.\n \n\n## Argo on the NVS\nArgo vocabularies on the NVS can be extracted in the VocPrez NVS Search interface by typing ‘argo’ in the vocabulary collections search bar and ticking ‘Governance’ only. The search result can be accessed through this link: [https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/cvl/?searchstr=argo&options=governance](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/cvl/?searchstr=argo&options=governance), and will display a list of all the Argo collections (or tables) created to date.\n\nPlease see below a list of all original Argo reference tables extracted from the Argo User Manual (‘No.’), their corresponding NVS collection IDs (‘Vocab’) and links to the NVS collections themselves as VocPrez search results (‘Search URL’):\n\nPlease note that each collection also has a static URL, linked in the ‘Vocabularies’ page on VocPrez: [https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/?filter=Argo](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/?filter=Argo).\n\n# The Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT)\nThe Argo NVS collections are overseen by a sub-group of the Argo Data Management Team called the Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT). Each AVTT member is responsible for a subset of Argo tables/collections, based on their interest and contributions. AVTT members are the Editors of the tables/collections, in charge of making appropriate changes on the NVS on behalf of the Argo community.\n\nThe work of the AVTT is coordinated by an AVTT facilitator and managed in the ArgoVocab repository of the OneArgo github: [https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs](https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs)\n\nThe AVTT meets several times per year in between annual ADMT meetings, to discuss requests from the Argo community for the evolution of Argo vocabularies.\n\n# How to request new entries and suggest changes to Argo vocabulary\nTo propose a new Argo code in a vocabulary or initiate a discussion about an existing concept or collection, anyone can open an issue in the ArgoVocabs repository under the OneArgo github:\n\n[https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs](https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs) \n\nIf the issue concerns a specific reference table, it is advised to label the issue with the name of the associated reference table (‘Rxx’). The issue is then assigned to the editor(s) in charge of the reference table. If the issue is a request for a new entry in a table, when approved, the new code is published on NVS, the Argo NetCDF file Format Checker is updated, and the issue is closed. In some cases where the decision is not straightforward, to ensure that the discussion is picked up, the Argo data management mailing list(s) may be contacted, providing the link to the Github issue in question. It is advisable to observe a two-week time limit to progress a discussion; if no comments or feedback ensue in that time frame, the decision can be considered approved by the AVTT and may be be implemented as suggested. If there is no consensus, or if the issue has large implications, the issue requires further discussion at the ADMT annual meeting. If you are unsure of which category your issue falls into, please do not hesitate to contact the ADMT co-chairs.\n\nAll Argo vocabulary issues are visible on the AVTT issues dashboard (a \"project\" under the OneArgo github), with associated status reflected in the various columns:\n\n[https://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/4/views/1](https://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/4/views/1)\n\nIf you need help or have questions about this process, please contact Danielle Wright or Victor Turpin.\n\n# Resources\nM2M access to the NVS via API (NVS SPARQL endpoint)\nFor machine to machine (M2M) access to the Argo Vocabularies on the NVS, the NVS SPARQL endpoint can be used.\n\nGeneral information on the NVS SPARQL endpoint can be found on the NVS website: [https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/sparql/](https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/sparql/)\n\nSPARQL queries can be integrated into code written in other programming languages (Python, Matlab etc.).\n\nFor a basic example, please see the \"m2m_NVS_sparql.ipynb\" file.\n\nTo test, open the file into a Jupyter Notebook; edit lines marked by '# Switch' to select either prefLabel/altLabel, and point to specific Argo vocabularies by inserting its name (e.g. 'R03') where the line is marked by '# Edit'.\n\n \nAccess to Argo vocabulary in python: argopy.ArgoNVSReferenceTables feature\nArgoNVSReferenceTables is a feature that easily provides access and search to Argo vocabularies from python:\n\n[https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata_fetching.html#reference-tables](https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata_fetching.html#reference-tables)\n\n[https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/argopy.related.ArgoNVSReferenceTables](https://argopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/argopy.related.ArgoNVSReferenceTables).\n\n## List of Argo vocabulary editors\n[https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs#editors-list](https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs#editors-list)\n\n## Updates on the NVS by editors\nArgo Vocabulary Editors can update the Argo NVS collections they are responsible for by using the NVS Vocab Editor.

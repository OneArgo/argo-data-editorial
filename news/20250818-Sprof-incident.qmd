Since August 4th, the production of Sprof files by Coriolis GDAC is not working properly.
Normal Sprof production may not resume until September.
In the interim, I will manually generate updates.

A S-prof file is a data format used to store data from an Argo float. It combines both physical measurements (temperature and salinity) and biogeochemical parameters into one file, simplifying data access and analysis.

**Incident Status**  
Between August 4 and September 3, the production of S-prof files by the Coriolis GDAC was partially or fully interrupted. The nominal generation of S-prof files resumed gradually, and the backlog was cleared on September 3.

An S-prof file is a data format used to store data from an Argo float. It combines both physical measurements (temperature and salinity) and biogeochemical parameters into a single file, which simplifies data access and analysis.

**Incident Resolution**

- Since August 19, 2025, the generation of S-prof (single and multi-profile) has partially resumed.
- On September 1, the generation of new multi-profile S-profs resumed as normal.
- On September 3, the backlog of S-profs (single and multi-profile) missing since August 4 was cleared.

Some S-prof files cannot be generated. They are listed at https://data-argo.ifremer.fr/etc/argo-synthetic-profile-log/  
The most common error concerns C-prof and B-prof files that do not have the same number of data levels.

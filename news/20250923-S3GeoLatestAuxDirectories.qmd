Since August 2023, the 'dac' branch of the GDAC Argo has been synchronized daily on Amazon S3:

- [https://registry.opendata.aws/argo-gdac-marinedata](https://registry.opendata.aws/argo-gdac-marinedata){target="_blank"}

The 'latest_data', 'geo', and 'aux' branches have now been added to the daily synchronization. This means all Argo data (profiles, trajectories, metadata, auxiliary data) are now accessible on AWS S3.

This synchronization on AWS S3 provides cloud-native access to the data, which greatly facilitates its use by the scientific community.

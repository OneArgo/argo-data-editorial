## Initial message
The FTP connection to the server ftp.ifremer.fr is blocked today, Monday, June 23rd.

As a result, GDAC Coriolis is unable to download files from the various DACs. We'll let you know once the situation returns to normal.

Synchronization with GDAC-US will allow GDAC Coriolis to stay up-to-date, but with a delay of several hours.

We apologize for this service degradation.

## Conclusion
The connection issue with the ftp.ifremer.fr server was **resolved on Wednesday, June 25, around 1:00 PM**.

It was ultimately limited to FTP downloads of Argo data for GDAC users. Contrary to what was initially reported, **the FTP upload of data by Argo DACs to the GDAC was not affected**.

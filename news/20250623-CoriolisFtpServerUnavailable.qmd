The FTP connection to the server ftp.ifremer.fr is blocked today, Monday, June 23rd.

As a result, GDAC Coriolis is unable to download files from the various DACs. We'll let you know once the situation returns to normal.

Synchronization with GDAC-US will allow GDAC Coriolis to stay up-to-date, but with a delay of several hours.

We apologize for this service degradation.

Three changes regarding the Argo GDAC were scheduled for Monday, June 30, 2025.

* **Renaming the Korean DAC KORDI to KIOST** (with no impact on NetCDF file content)
* **Removing the Argo GDAC greylist** (no more public access)
* **Restricting access to the argo_sensor_exclusion_list.txt** (which replaces the greylist) to on-demand access (by request to sismer@ifremer.fr).

This update was finalized on June 30, 2025, at 12:10 UTC.

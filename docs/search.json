The Argo Data Management Team chose in 2019 to use the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS), to further enhance Argo data interoperability\nArgo vocabularies are always evolving, to reflect evolution of Argo technology. These evolutions are managed by the Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT), under the umbrella of the ADMT.\n\n\nThe NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) provides access to lists of standardised terms that cover a broad spectrum of the oceanographic domain and associated communities. The NVS is technically-managed and hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), a national facility that is part of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre (NOC). Key funding sources for the NVS include the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as well as European Union’s initiatives such as the Open Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, the SeaDataNet / SeaDataCloud projects and the Horizons 2020 ENVRI-FAIR project.\nThe NVS conforms to a set of standards designed to be compatible with Semantic Web tools and technologies, allowing its content to support the interoperability of datasets on the Web known as Linked Data. The NVS can be accessed via content negotiation (as RDF/XML), SPARQL endpoint or SOAP web services, upon which browser access is built.\n\n\n\nThe NVS web user interface is called VocPrez, and can be accessed through the link vocab.nerc.ac.uk. VocPrez hosts general information on controlled vocabularies, a complete list of NVS collections (under ‘Vocabularies’) and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) concept schemes (under ‘Thesauri’), an interactive SPARQL endpoint to allow for machine-readable NVS query responses, and link to other tools hosted on the BODC website.\nOne of the most useful features of VocPrez is the NVS Search interface. This allows a user to search for a term (aka ‘concept’) in a vocabulary collection; search for a term across vocabulary collections; search for vocabulary collections; and explore mappings (i.e. relationships) of terms linking different collections. Search results may be downloaded in tab-delimited (tsv) as well as comma-delimited (csv) formats; moreover, search queries produce search results links that may be bookmarked and shared.\n\n\n\nArgo vocabularies on the NVS can be extracted in the VocPrez NVS Search interface by typing ‘argo’ in the vocabulary collections search bar and ticking ‘Governance’ only. The search result can be accessed through this link: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/cvl/?searchstr=argo&options=governance, and will display a list of all the Argo collections (or tables) created to date.\nPlease see below a list of all original Argo reference tables extracted from the Argo User Manual (‘No.’), their corresponding NVS collection IDs (‘Vocab’) and links to the NVS collections themselves as VocPrez search results (‘Search URL’):\nPlease note that each collection also has a static URL, linked in the ‘Vocabularies’ page on VocPrez: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/?filter=Argo."

    "text": "Argo Reference database for delayed mode QC\nThe free-moving nature of profiling floats means that most float measurements are without accompanying in-situ “ground truth” values for absolute calibration (such as those afforded by shipboard CTD measurements). Therefore Argo delayed-mode procedures for checking sensor drifts and offsets in salinity rely on reference datasets and statistical methods.\n\nLatest version of the Argo reference database\nThe CTD reference database for Argo is updated on a yearly bases by Coriolis team or when there are enough new data to justify an upgrade. The CTD are provided by the PIs, the ARC, Clivar Hydrographic Center and NODC/USA. In areas with poor CTD data, good Argo profiles are used for the delayed mode QC. This Argo reference database is updated by SCRIPPS (J Gilson).\nAccess to reference databases\nBecause the CTD database may contain CTD data that is not yet freely available, access is restricted to those performing DMQC on the data. To request access, email codac@ifremet.fr.\nDecember 2022 A new version of the ARGO climatology (ARGO_for_DMQC_2022V03) is available on the ftp site.\n\n\n\nJanuary 2022 A new version of the ARGO climatology (ARGO_for_DMQC_2021V03) is available on the ftp site.\n\n\n\nDecember 2021 A new version of the CTD reference database (2021V02) is available on the ftp site. This version takes into account some corrections following the feedback received by the users. Some CTDs have also been added: CTDs provided by scientists, CTDs made during float deployments and some GO-SHIP CTDs retrieved from the CCHDO website.\n\n\n\nMarch 2021 A new version of the CTD reference database (2021V01) is available on the ftp site. This version takes into account the GO-SHIP Easy Ocean dataset (flag GSD in QCLEVEL), dedicated to delayed mode deep Argo floats data, as well as somes new CTD (CCHDO, scientists,…).\n\n\n\nJanuary 2022 A new version of the ARGO climatology (ARGO_for_DMQC_2021V03) is available on the ftp site.\n\n\n\nApril 2015 A new version of the ARGO climatology (ARGO_for_DMQC_2015V01) is available on the ftp site\n\n\n\nJanuary 2015 A new version of the ARGO climatology (ARGO_for_DMQC_2014V04) is available on the ftp site\n\n\n\nDecember 2014 A new version of the CTD reference database (2014V01) is available on the ftp site.

This version, that you must reference as ARGO2008V01, takes into account the conversion ITS90 to ITS68 for the temperature. The Argo float Ref DB (argo_clim) provided by John Gilson is also available on the same ftp site.\nNote : If you detect an anomalie in the ARGO2008V01 database, please report to codac indicating the code ‘source’ of the station concerned (in the file ctd_&lt;n°box&gt;.mat) and the correction to be applied : the “source” code allow us to link the data provider and the reference of the station and to provide feedback to the provider to avoid getting the same problem while updating the database.\n\n\nPrevious versions of Argo Reference Data Base\nTo process delayed mode quality control on floats, each DM operator has improved the database for his area and we have at present 4 different reference databases : SeHyd for the Pacific, IOHB for the Indian, BS (Böhme-Send) + ATL CTD or Hydrobase for the Atlantic.\nSeHYD and IOHB are available in a form suitable as input files (wmo_boxes) fro WJO/OW. IOHB has data formatted in both WJO standard levels and as full profiles. SeHYD is available only at WJO standard levels.\nOn the following links, you will have access to those different regional reference databases :\nAtlantic Ocean Recent CTD from Coriolis and Böhme-Send method contact : Codac Atlantic Hydrobase : web site hydrobase\nPacific Ocean SeHyd from JAMSTEC contact : Taiyo Kobayashi\nIndian Ocean Indian Ocean HydroBase from JAMSTEC IOHB contact : Taiyo Kobayashi\nSouthern Ocean SODB : web site SODB\nCCHDO Clivar & Carbon Hydrographic Data Office Link to the CCHDO web site CCHDO has extracted for ARGO recent CTD( 2001-2006) and made them accessible to the Argo Delayed mode operators. These data ore on the ifremer ftp site. Please contact codac@ifremer.fr to get an user name / password\nBe careful that all those datasets must be only used for the delayed mode quality control of the Argo floats, some data of the added cruises have confidential access."

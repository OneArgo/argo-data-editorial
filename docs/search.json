Argo GDAC data DOI global attribute is optional and recommended https://github.com/nvs-vocabs/ArgoVocabs/issues/43 and https://github.com/OneArgo/ADMT/issues/72\n§2.2.4 §2.3.4 §2.4.4 PI_NAME has a controlled vocabulary https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/6\n§2.4.7.1 SENSOR_FIRMWARE_VERSION https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/55\n§2.4.5 deployment_platform dimension extended to string128 https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/2#issuecomment-2437421119\n§2.2.4 §2.3.4 §2.4.4 PROJECT_NAME comment revision\n§2.4.4 add PROGRAM_NAME variable https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/5\n§2.4.4 PROJECT_NAME long_name changed\n§2.4.7.1 SENSOR_MODEL comment clarification: the new definition of SENSOR_MODEL is “as defined by the sensor manufacturer” (reference table R27) https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/55\n§3.22 … §3.28: remove the remaining tyinurl\n§3.1 add “Argo auxiliary meta-data” data type\n§3.2.1: add a comment to provide examples when *_qc= ’ ’ can occur as per https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/21\n§3.3. remove the sentence about FillValue = 99999.f. The FillValue of various parameters are now specified in R03.\n§3.3.1 How to indicate multiple sensors for the same parameter https://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs/issues/81\n§3.11 change from grey list to supplemental sensor exclusion list in reference table 11 (example) https://github.com/OneArgo/ADMT/discussions/70\n§3.33 add PI_NAME reference table\n§4.1.2.2. Under File Naming Convention, change the filename prefix of the synthetic files from “M” to “S”.\n§6.2 remove greylist paragraph https://github.com/OneArgo/ADMT/discussions/70\n§6.2 “Grey list” removed: the greylist management is internal, documented in the Quality control manual.\n\nNote: the version 3.42.0 was published in May 2025, but not advertised. The 19 changes are from both the 3.42.0 and 3.43.0 versions. See the details in page 12 of the manual."

Data are distributed to PIs and the GTS within 24 hours of the float surfacing. They also send the data to the Global Data Centers. • Global Data Centres (GDACS): two distribution points of Argo data distribution on Internet. They are located in Coriolis/Ifremer/France and US GODAE/USA .Coordination between these centres occurs daily. • Delayed Mode Operators: they carry out delayed mode QC and return data to National Centres within a year of observations. • Argo Regional Centres (ARCs ): they check the consistency of the Argo data for a specified geographical area. They also foster the collection of recent CTD data for delayed mode purposes, organize delayed mode QC of floats, provide specific Argo products. • Argo Information Centre (AIC): located at OceanOPS in ToulouseBrest, France, responsible for providing information on the Argo program. • Argo long term archive: data Centre located in NODC/USA in charge of ensuring the long term archive of all the Argo data."

    "text": "Argo vocabularies Argo vocabularies, originally known as reference tables, are used extensively to constrain the contents of the Argo NetCDF files, and to enhance the interoperability of the Argo data system. The Argo Data Management Team chose in 2019 to use the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS), to further enhance Argo data interoperability\nArgo vocabularies are always evolving, to reflect evolution of Argo technology. These evolutions are managed by the Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT), under the umbrella of the ADMT.\nThe NVS The NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) provides access to lists of standardised terms that cover a broad spectrum of the oceanographic domain and associated communities. The NVS is technically-managed and hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), a national facility that is part of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre (NOC). Key funding sources for the NVS include the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as well as European Union’s initiatives such as the Open Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, the SeaDataNet / SeaDataCloud projects and the Horizons 2020 ENVRI-FAIR project.\nThe NVS conforms to a set of standards designed to be compatible with Semantic Web tools and technologies, allowing its content to support the interoperability of datasets on the Web known as Linked Data. The NVS can be accessed via content negotiation (as RDF/XML), SPARQL endpoint or SOAP web services, upon which browser access is built.\nVocPrez The NVS web user interface is called VocPrez, and can be accessed through the link vocab.nerc.ac.uk. VocPrez hosts general information on controlled vocabularies, a complete list of NVS collections (under ‘Vocabularies’) and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) concept schemes (under ‘Thesauri’), an interactive SPARQL endpoint to allow for machine-readable NVS query responses, and link to other tools hosted on the BODC website.\nOne of the most useful features of VocPrez is the NVS Search interface. This allows a user to search for a term (aka ‘concept’) in a vocabulary collection; search for a term across vocabulary collections; search for vocabulary collections; and explore mappings (i.e. relationships) of terms linking different collections. Search results may be downloaded in tab-delimited (tsv) as well as comma-delimited (csv) formats; moreover, search queries produce search results links that may be bookmarked and shared.\nArgo on the NVS Argo vocabularies on the NVS can be extracted in the VocPrez NVS Search interface by typing ‘argo’ in the vocabulary collections search bar and ticking ‘Governance’ only. The search result can be accessed through this link: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/cvl/?searchstr=argo&options=governance, and will display a list of all the Argo collections (or tables) created to date.\nPlease see below a list of all original Argo reference tables extracted from the Argo User Manual (‘No.’), their corresponding NVS collection IDs (‘Vocab’) and links to the NVS collections themselves as VocPrez search results (‘Search URL’):\nPlease note that each collection also has a static URL, linked in the ‘Vocabularies’ page on VocPrez: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/?filter=Argo."

    "text": "How to request new entries and suggest changes to Argo vocabulary\nTo propose a new Argo code in a vocabulary or initiate a discussion about an existing concept or collection, anyone can open an issue in the ArgoVocabs repository under the OneArgo github:\nhttps://github.com/OneArgo/ArgoVocabs\nIf the issue concerns a specific reference table, it is advised to label the issue with the name of the associated reference table (‘Rxx’). The issue is then assigned to the editor(s) in charge of the reference table. If the issue is a request for a new entry in a table, when approved, the new code is published on NVS, the Argo NetCDF file Format Checker is updated, and the issue is closed. In some cases where the decision is not straightforward, to ensure that the discussion is picked up, the Argo data management mailing list(s) may be contacted, providing the link to the Github issue in question. It is advisable to observe a two-week time limit to progress a discussion; if no comments or feedback ensue in that time frame, the decision can be considered approved by the AVTT and may be be implemented as suggested. If there is no consensus, or if the issue has large implications, the issue requires further discussion at the ADMT annual meeting. If you are unsure of which category your issue falls into, please do not hesitate to contact the ADMT co-chairs.\nAll Argo vocabulary issues are visible on the AVTT issues dashboard (a “project” under the OneArgo github), with associated status reflected in the various columns:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/4/views/1\nIf you need help or have questions about this process, please contact Danielle Wright or Victor Turpin."

Therefore Argo delayed-mode procedures for checking sensor drifts and offsets in salinity rely on reference datasets and statistical methods.\n\nLatest version of the Argo reference database\nThe CTD reference database for Argo is updated on a yearly bases by Coriolis team or when there are enough new data to justify an upgrade. The CTD are provided by the PIs, the ARC, Clivar Hydrographic Center and NODC/USA. In areas with poor CTD data, good Argo profiles are used for the delayed mode QC. This Argo reference database is updated by SCRIPPS (J Gilson).\nAccess to reference databases\nBecause the CTD database may contain CTD data that is not yet freely available, access is restricted to those performing DMQC on the data.

    "text": "Originally known as reference tables, they are used extensively to constrain the contents of the Argo NetCDF files, and to enhance the interoperability of the Argo data system. The Argo Data Management Team chose in 2019 to use the NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS), to further enhance Argo data interoperability\nArgo vocabularies are always evolving, to reflect evolution of Argo technology. These evolutions are managed by the Argo Vocabulary Task Team (AVTT), under the umbrella of the ADMT.\n\n\nThe NERC Vocabulary Server (NVS) provides access to lists of standardised terms that cover a broad spectrum of the oceanographic domain and associated communities. The NVS is technically-managed and hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), a national facility that is part of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre (NOC). Key funding sources for the NVS include the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as well as European Union’s initiatives such as the Open Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, the SeaDataNet / SeaDataCloud projects and the Horizons 2020 ENVRI-FAIR project.\nThe NVS conforms to a set of standards designed to be compatible with Semantic Web tools and technologies, allowing its content to support the interoperability of datasets on the Web known as Linked Data. The NVS can be accessed via content negotiation (as RDF/XML), SPARQL endpoint or SOAP web services, upon which browser access is built.\n\n\n\nThe NVS web user interface is called VocPrez, and can be accessed through the link vocab.nerc.ac.uk. VocPrez hosts general information on controlled vocabularies, a complete list of NVS collections (under ‘Vocabularies’) and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) concept schemes (under ‘Thesauri’), an interactive SPARQL endpoint to allow for machine-readable NVS query responses, and link to other tools hosted on the BODC website.\nOne of the most useful features of VocPrez is the NVS Search interface. This allows a user to search for a term (aka ‘concept’) in a vocabulary collection; search for a term across vocabulary collections; search for vocabulary collections; and explore mappings (i.e. relationships) of terms linking different collections. Search results may be downloaded in tab-delimited (tsv) as well as comma-delimited (csv) formats; moreover, search queries produce search results links that may be bookmarked and shared.\n\n\n\nArgo vocabularies on the NVS can be extracted in the VocPrez NVS Search interface by typing ‘argo’ in the vocabulary collections search bar and ticking ‘Governance’ only. The search result can be accessed through this link: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/search_nvs/cvl/?searchstr=argo&options=governance, and will display a list of all the Argo collections (or tables) created to date.\nPlease see below a list of all original Argo reference tables extracted from the Argo User Manual (‘No.’), their corresponding NVS collection IDs (‘Vocab’) and links to the NVS collections themselves as VocPrez search results (‘Search URL’):\nPlease note that each collection also has a static URL, linked in the ‘Vocabularies’ page on VocPrez: https://vocab.nerc.ac.uk/collection/?filter=Argo."

The issue is then assigned to the editor(s) in charge of the reference table. If the issue is a request for a new entry in a table, when approved, the new code is published on NVS, the Argo NetCDF file Format Checker is updated, and the issue is closed. In some cases where the decision is not straightforward, to ensure that the discussion is picked up, the Argo data management mailing list(s) may be contacted, providing the link to the Github issue in question. It is advisable to observe a two-week time limit to progress a discussion; if no comments or feedback ensue in that time frame, the decision can be considered approved by the AVTT and may be be implemented as suggested. If there is no consensus, or if the issue has large implications, the issue requires further discussion at the ADMT annual meeting. If you are unsure of which category your issue falls into, please do not hesitate to contact the ADMT co-chairs.\nAll Argo vocabulary issues are visible on the AVTT issues dashboard (a “project” under the OneArgo github), with associated status reflected in the various columns:\nhttps://github.com/orgs/OneArgo/projects/4/views/1\nIf you need help or have questions about this process, please contact Danielle Wright or Victor Turpin."

The NVS is technically-managed and hosted by the British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC), a national facility that is part of the UK’s National Oceanography Centre (NOC). Key funding sources for the NVS include the UK’s Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as well as European Union’s initiatives such as the Open Network for Marine Environmental Data (NETMAR) programme, the SeaDataNet / SeaDataCloud projects and the Horizons 2020 ENVRI-FAIR project.\nThe NVS conforms to a set of standards designed to be compatible with Semantic Web tools and technologies, allowing its content to support the interoperability of datasets on the Web known as Linked Data. The NVS can be accessed via content negotiation (as RDF/XML), SPARQL endpoint or SOAP web services, upon which browser access is built."

VocPrez hosts general information on controlled vocabularies, a complete list of NVS collections (under ‘Vocabularies’) and Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) concept schemes (under ‘Thesauri’), an interactive SPARQL endpoint to allow for machine-readable NVS query responses, and link to other tools hosted on the BODC website.\nOne of the most useful features of VocPrez is the NVS Search interface. This allows a user to search for a term (aka ‘concept’) in a vocabulary collection; search for a term across vocabulary collections; search for vocabulary collections; and explore mappings (i.e. relationships) of terms linking different collections. Search results may be downloaded in tab-delimited (tsv) as well as comma-delimited (csv) formats; moreover, search queries produce search results links that may be bookmarked and shared."
